# TypeScript basics

Repository with exercises to understand basic TypeScript concepts.

## What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a Javascript superset designed for the development of robust applications, as it allows early detection of many of the most basic problems that can occur during the development of a website.

TypeScript adds additional syntax to JavaScript to support a tighter integration with your editor. Catch errors early in your editor.

TypeScript code converts to JavaScript, which runs anywhere JavaScript runs: In a browser, on Node.js or Deno and in your apps.

TypeScript understands JavaScript and uses type inference to give you great tooling without additional code.
